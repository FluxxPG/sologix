          </h2>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-center mb-6">
            Under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, 1 crore (10 million) households will receive 300 units of free electricity every month. This scheme will result in annual savings of â‚¹15,000 crore for these families. Additionally, they can sell surplus power generated from solar panels to their local power distribution companies (DISCOMs), generating extra income.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-center">
            The initiative will boost electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, and the increased demand for solar panel supply and installation will create large-scale entrepreneurial opportunities for vendors. Moreover, the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of solar panels will generate abundant employment opportunities for technically skilled youth.
